**Introduction**
StudyNotion offers an interactive learning experience for students and a platform for instructors to share their knowledge globally. We'll cover the platform's architecture, API design, installation, usage, and future enhancements.

**System Architecture**
StudyNotion has three main components: the front-end, back-end, and database. It follows a client-server architecture, with the front-end acting as the client and the back-end and database as the server.

**Front-end**
The front-end, built with ReactJS, provides dynamic and responsive user interfaces. It communicates with the back-end via RESTful API calls.

**Front-end Pages**

c. Wishlist
d. Cart Checkout
e. Course Content
f. User Details
g. User Edit Details

For Instructors:
a. Dashboard
b. Insights

**Back-end**
The back-end, built with NodeJS and ExpressJS, provides APIs for user authentication, course management, and media handling.

Features:
a. User Authentication
b. Course Management
c. Payment Integration
d. Cloud-based Media
e. Markdown Formatting

**Database**
StudyNotion uses MongoDB to store course content and user data, providing flexibility and scalability.

**API Design**
StudyNotion's API follows REST principles, using JSON for data exchange and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Refer to the API Documentation for detailed endpoints.
